            <h3>The Offside Rule</h3>
            <p>The offside rule is one of the harder rules to understand if you are new to the sport this is an explination of the offsides rule</p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Offside Position:</b> You know how there are two goalposts, right? Well, if you're standing closer to the opposition's goal than the ball and the second-to-last defender (the second-to-last player trying to stop you) when someone passes the ball to you, you're in an "offside position."</li>
                <li><b>Not Always a Problem:</b> Just being in an offside position is okay as long as you aren't involved in the current play, the ball is on the other side of the field, or you aren't disturbing the defenders from doing their job if you are in an offsides position</li>
                <li><b>Getting Involved:</b> If you use your offside position to score a goal or stop the defenders from doing their job, then the referee might say you are "offside," and your team won't get the point.</li>
                <li><b>Exceptions:</b> But wait! If you're in your own half of the field or you're in line with the last two defenders, then you're safe. You can't be offside in those cases.</li>
                <li><b>Why It Matters:</b> The offside rule is there to keep the game fair. It wouldn't be fair if someone just hung out near the opponent's goal all the time, waiting to score without really playing with the rest of the team.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>

            <h3>The Card System</h3>
            <p>The card system was implimented to keep the players safe and not continuously injure each other. There are two card that are able to be recieved during a game, yellow and red, where each could be given depending on the foul that was received</p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Yellow Card:</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>What it means:</b> A yellow card is a caution or warning given to a player as a penalty for committing a foul or an unsportsmanlike behavior.</li>
                        <li><b>Reasons for a yellow card:</b> Players can receive a yellow card for various reasons, such as dangerous tackles, intentionally obstructing opponents, time-wasting, dissent (arguing with the referee), and other unsportsmanlike conduct.</li>
                        <li><b>Consequence:</b> When a player receives a yellow card, it serves as a warning. If the same player gets another yellow card in the same game, it results in a red card, and they must leave the field (be sent off).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>Red Card:</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>What it means:</b> A red card is a more serious penalty that results in a player being sent off the field for the remainder of the game. A team that receives a red card must play with one fewer player for the rest of the match.</li>
                        <li><b>Reasons for a Red card:</b> A red card is usually given for more severe offenses, such as violent conduct, serious foul play, intentionally denying an obvious goal-scoring opportunity by committing a foul, or receiving a second yellow card in the same game.</li>
                        <li><b>Consequence:</b> The team with a player receiving a red card plays with one less player for the rest of the match, and the player who received the red card may face additional disciplinary consequences depending on the severity of the offense.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <hr>
        <li>
            <h3>Throw-ins</h3>
            <p>Throw in were implimented into the game so that if the ball crosses the out-of-bounds line, the game could have a way to start again.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Proper throw-in:</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Execution:</b> A throw-in is taken by a player from the team that did not touch the ball last before it went out of bounds.
                            <br>The player must stand outside the field of play, with both feet on or behind the touchline. They hold the ball with both hands and deliver it back into play.</li>
                        <li><b>Proper Technique:</b> The player must use both hands to throw the ball from behind and over their head.
                            <br>The throw must start and finish with both feet on or behind the touchline.</li>
                        <li><b>Direction:</b> The ball must be thrown from the point where it went out of bounds.
                            <br>The throw-in should be taken facing the field, and the player should not step onto the field until after releasing the ball.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>Improper Throw-in:</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Feet over the line:</b> If the player steps onto the field with one or both feet before releasing the ball, it is considered a foul throw, and the throw-in is awarded to the opposing team.</li>
                        <li><b>Incorrect Technique:</b> If the player fails to use both hands or fails to throw the ball over their head, it may be considered a foul throw.</li>
                        <li><b>Directional Violation:</b> The ball must be thrown in the correct direction, perpendicular to the touchline. If the player throws the ball parallel to the touchline or at an angle, it may be considered a foul throw.</li>
                        <li><b>Retaking the Throw:</b> If a throw-in is improperly taken, the opposing team is awarded a throw-in from the same spot. The player who committed the foul throw may be instructed to retake it correctly.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>

            <h3>Set Pieces</h3>
            <p>Set pieces provide teams with strategic opportunities to score goals, defend against attacks, or simply regain control of the ball. Coaches and players often work on specific plays and tactics for set-piece situations, utilizing the skills of certain players to maximize their effectiveness. Successful execution of set pieces can play a crucial role in the outcome of a soccer match.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Free kick:</b> 
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Offensive Free Kick:</b> Awarded to a team when an opposing player commits a foul. The team can take a direct shot on goal or use it to set up a planned play.</li>
                        <li><b>Defensive Free Kick:</b> Awarded to the opposing team after an offensive player commits a foul. The defending team aims to clear the ball away from their goal.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>Corner kick:</b> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Awarded when the defending team is the last to touch the ball before it crosses its own goal line. The attacking team takes the corner kick from the corner arc nearest to where the ball went out. It's an opportunity to create scoring chances by delivering the ball into the penalty area.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>Goal kick:</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Awarded to the defending team when the ball crosses the goal line after being touched last by an attacking player. The defending team takes a goal kick from within their goal area, and it's a chance to restart play and regain possession.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>Throw-ins:</b> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Awarded to the team opposite to the one that last touched the ball before it went out of bounds over the touchline (sideline). A player takes a throw-in by using both hands to deliver the ball from behind and over their head. It's an opportunity to restart play from the sideline.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ul>
