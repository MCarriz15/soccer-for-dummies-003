The top four teams of this league qualify to play in the Champions League. The Bundesliga consists of 18 teams that compete against each other in a round-robin format. This means that every team goes against every other team twice, one home, and one away.  The teams that finish the season in the bottom two positions are relegated to the 2. Bundesliga, the second tier of German football. Teams earn three points for a win, one point for a draw, and no points for a loss. The league table is determined by points, and in case of a tie in points, tiebreakers such as goal difference and goals scored are used to rank teams.</p>
