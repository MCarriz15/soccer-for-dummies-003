        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p class="intro-text">
            Soccer, also known as football in many parts of the world, is a team sport played between two teams of eleven players each. The objective of the game is to score goals by getting a round ball into the opponent's goal. Players use their feet, head, or any part of their body except their hands and arms (except for the goalkeeper) to move the ball and score goals.
            The game is played on a rectangular field called a pitch, and each team defends one goal while trying to score in the other. The team with the most goals at the end of the match wins. Soccer is known for its simplicity â€“ all you need is a ball, a field, and a few players to have a game. It's a sport that emphasizes teamwork, skill, and strategy.
